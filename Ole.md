# OLE Object Linked and Embedded
Ole is a class, subclass of [MInimal JSON](https://github.com/ralfstx/minimal-json) which provides some META fields to arrange a plain JSON Object and provide additional value-added services to encode structured data such as files, either binary or ascii, config files, list of items (sets), queries to relational databases, data tables (including those results generated by database queries).

It is a JsonObject with a META field that contains semantic data about its content.
- OLE-ID: An alphanumeric hash code of the object 
- TYPE: An enum type wich describe the type/subtype of Ole objects. Every subtype is also a JsonObject with specific inputs and values
